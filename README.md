# 8_and_15_Puzzle_Search

In this assignment you will explore State-Space Search with the 8-Puzzle and 15-Puzzle.  You will need to implement and provide code for the following algorithms:
-Breadth-First Search
-Depth-First Search
-Iterative-Deepening Depth-First Search
-A* w/ Out-Of-Place, and Manhattan Distance Heuristics
-Iterative Deepening A* w/ Out-Of-Place, and Manhattan Distance Heuristics

Develop search code with requirements:
-Input puzzle as a two strings, initial state and goal state.
-Produce the solution as a string of "udlr" representing the move "up", "down", "left", and "right" for the movement of the blank.
-Produce the number of expanded nodes required to find solution.

In addition, develop code to test a solution with requirements:
-Input initial puzzle state as string.
-Input move sequence as string.
-Produce output state from applying move sequence to initial state.
